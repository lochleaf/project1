                <p class="infoaboutus">Elizabeth Arden was a pioneer in cosmetics, turning beauty into both a symbol and a global business. She opened her first ever salon in 1930 on Fifth Avenue, later expanding to Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C., and globally in Europe and South America, while adapting her services for budget-conscious clients during the Great Depression. Arden pursued ambitious ventures, including radio sponsorships and specialized makeup lines. She also made her company into a health and beauty farm. Her winged logo became a lasting symbol of elegance, the same as her iconic lipstick. Arden’s legacy reflects determination, vision, and resilience, inspiring women to stand proud, confident, and beautiful during war times.</p>
